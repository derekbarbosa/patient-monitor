### Branches:

## Active Branches:
* Main

## Cloud Hosting:
App hosted at http://44.201.167.159:8000/ on EC2 instance

## How to use this API:
Currently, the only serialized "view" available via Django is the /users/ view (on the aforementioned application).
Doing a "Get" request will allow you to view the list of users :)

## How our data will be organized:
