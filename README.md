# Patient Monitor System

### Branches:
I will be using separate branches, and merging them one-by-one on successful unit tests

Current testing suite -- 14 tests
Tests currently cover:
* Model creation and retrieval 
* GET request retrieval/serialization

## Active Branches:
* Main
* endpoints
* queueing (paused)

## Inactive Branches
* chat_module (DELETED, merged into main 3/23/22)

## How to use this API:
Currently, all views are serialized. Specified endpoints + cleanup will be coming soon.

Deploying the app locally will allow you to GET/POST to the endpoints specified in the models.py

Doing a "Get" request will allow you to view the list of users :)

## How our data will be organized:
